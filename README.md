    Uploaded tokyo.wmv

You can get information on on a file in Mega:

    % megabot.sh -g -f tokyo.wmv

You'll see output of information on the file:

    File information on Mega:
    tokyo.wmv 11.2 MiB
    https://mega.co.nz/#!YRtD0DoI!iFFsJMze-DHLb343VZ1LMqvqsVF65vbG8LwzYyE98rg

You can send file information to Slack:

    % megabot.sh -s -f tokyo.wmv

You'll see output of the curl command to post to a Slack webhook:

    Slack command: eval curl -X POST --data-urlencode 'payload={"channel": "#megabot", "username": "megabot", "text": "tokyo.wmv 11.2 MiB\nhttps://mega.co.nz/#!YRtD0DoI!iFFsJMze-DHLb343VZ1LMqvqsVF65vbG8LwzYyE98rg", "icon_emoji": ":megabot:"}' https://hooks.slack.com/services/YOURKEYHEREÂ  >/dev/null 2>&1

You can do all these things at once too:

If you don't like output you can make any options quiet:

    % megabot.sh -q -u -f tokyo.wmv
    % megabot.sh -q -s -f tokyo.wmv
    % megabot.sh -q -a -f tokyo.wmv
